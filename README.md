# connect_and_send_file_ssl
A script I wrote that connects to an ssl-enabled port, sends a file, and receives back data. Can scan for and attempt to connect to open ports or connect to a specified port.
## Use
```
$ git clone https://github.com/JoanneExists/connect_and_send_file_ssl.git
$ cd connect_and_send_file_ssl/
$ chmod +x connect_and_send_file_ssl.py
$ ./connect_and_send_file_ssl -h
```
This will call the script with the 'help' flag for info on how to use the script.
